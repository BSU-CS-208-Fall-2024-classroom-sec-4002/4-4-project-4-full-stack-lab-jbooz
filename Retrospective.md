## Experience

For this project I used manual testing and comparing my tests to those performed
in the video walkthrough to line them up as closely as possible. During this
project something I struggled with the most was getting the back-end to connect to
the front-end. I didn't understand why I was having so many errors thrown at me while
trying to run the website with the code that was implemented, but I eventually
discovered that I had structured the pug code wrong and wasn't using my inputs in the
form properly. Personally, I thought that the first portion that involved creating the
pug code was very ambigious and didn't give much direction in creating the website that
was intended. I get that the idea is to be creative, but I think there should at least
be a list of guidelines or steps to take just to give this portion of the project a sense
of direction. I was able to complete the project in it's entirety, and it seems to work
as intended. While working on this project I learned that surrounding input tags with
paragraph tags can actually alter their functionality, causing them to not work as intended,
which was also something that I had to fix to make my site work properly. This project took
quite some time to complete, but I have also learned some new things about using SQLite and
JavaScript in a full stack web environment.
